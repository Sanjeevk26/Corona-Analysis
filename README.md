# Corona-Analysis
I have tried to scrape data from various websites and plot the data after cleaning it.
There are 2 parts of the analysis
1. India
2. World

I have taken help of basic data science libraries like nuumpy and pandas for wrangling. 
For plotting data I have taken help of Plotly, Matplotlib, Geopandas etc.

The analysis is quite old so to replicate the code, you might have to use tweak the code to scrape data.
